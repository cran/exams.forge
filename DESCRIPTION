Description: The main aim is to further facilitate the creation of exercises based on the package 'exams' 
    by Gr√ºn, B., and Zeileis, A. (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i10>. Creating effective student exercises 
    involves challenges such as creating appropriate data sets and ensuring access to intermediate values 
    for accurate explanation of solutions. The functionality includes the generation of univariate and 
    bivariate data including simple time series, functions for theoretical distributions and their approximation, 
    statistical and mathematical calculations for tasks in basic statistics courses as well as general tasks 
    such as string manipulation, LaTeX/HTML formatting and the editing of XML task files for 'Moodle'.
